// Chakra UI v3: Drawer uses compound component pattern (same as Dialog)
// See: https://chakra-ui.com/docs/get-started/migration


// Export Drawer compound components (v3 recommended pattern)
export {
  Drawer
} from '@chakra-ui/react'

// Re-export with v2 names for backward compatibility during migration
// These are deprecated - use Drawer.* components instead
