# Elasticsearch

*[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro.html)* provides near real-time search and analytics for all types of data, including structured and unstructured text, numerical data, and  geospatial data. Elasticsearch is a distributed document store that stores complex data structures that have been serialized as JSON documents.

The Platform data infrastructure supports Elasticsearch as an option for a document database.
