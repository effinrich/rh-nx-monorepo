# Template: Creative Brief

Discover how to craft an effective creative brief that will help guide your marketing efforts.

A creative brief is a document that provides strategic guidance and direction for a creative project. It is the foundational hub that lays out the project’s objectives, goals, audiences, messages, guidelines, deliverables, budget, and more. Have the brief in hand before seeking freelance talent.

It generally includes the following sections, which can be modified to match project needs:

* Project Overview & Goals
* Stakeholders
* Inspiration / Benchmarks
* Messaging
* Audience
* Key Deliverables
* Timeline
