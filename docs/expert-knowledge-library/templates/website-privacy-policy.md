# Template: Website Privacy Policy

A website privacy policy is a statement that describes how your website collects, uses, and manages the personal data of website users. It allows users to make informed decisions about their personal information. It’s usually written to the user (”you”) and linked conspicuously on the company website, often in the footer.

This template includes sections such as:

- Introduction (an overview of where information is collected from)

- Information we collect about you

- How we collect information about you

- How we use your information

- Disclosure of your information

- Choices about how we use and disclose your information

- Promotions for our products and services

- Your rights regarding your information

- And more

During your bounded engagement, work with your Relationship Manager and Redesign Legal Point of Contact for questions about how to best use this template.
