# Data Room Template

**Use this template to develop your company’s data room as you prepare to fundraise.**

**Considerations ahead of developing your data room and fundraising plan:**

- **Legal consideration about confidential information**

    * *Companies should ensure that they have NDAs in place with any prospective investors before sharing any confidential information/documents.*

- **Diligence materials appropriate for the round/stage of round**

    * **Educate yourself in advance about what kinds of documents are typically provided to investors in diligence for the round you are raising.** Redesign Health’s Strategy & Finance team can be helpful here.

           * For example, if raising a Seed round: there are a lot of Series A investors moving down to seed stage investing, and they will go into Series A evaluation mode if you provide them with that level of detail. You should not need to provide a pro forma profit and loss (P&L) forecast; instead, focus on the total addressable market (TAM), unit economics, and enterprise and/or customer value proposition.

    * **When you are soliciting term sheets, keep your diligence materials to a minimum**: summary cap table; historical financials; investor deck; projection model and KPIs; monthly management report; executives summary bios; top customers/partners list (not contracts); bylaws and articles.

           * If you share critical information, investors who ultimately do not participate in your round may use that information against you (e.g., if you share management compensation contracts, a potential investor could use that information to poach team members for a competing investment).

    * Once you have a signed term sheet, you can respond to more robust diligence requests with a more comprehensive data room.

- **Management team**

    * Consider having another strong executive speak with investors, such as the CEO and COO. A strong 1-2 punch is important to build credibility.

- **Inaccurate information**

    * If VCs discover inaccurate data while performing due diligence, it could cause them to pull out of the deal. Companies should avoid overpromising on stages of product development, inflating their customer base or pipeline, and misrepresenting revenue, growth rates, or other financials.

- **Projections**

    * A VC may reconsider a deal if a company falls drastically short of projections between the initial deal review and the legal due diligence phase.

    * When dealing with investors, strive to be realistic in your projections. If metrics such as revenue, total sales, customers, users, or site traffic fluctuate by season, share this with investors so you don’t catch them off guard.
