## Summary of the Advisor Agreement Template

Our template advisor agreement includes the following terms and conditions. The “Company” refers to the company (OpCo) that contracts with the advisor.

### <u>Body of Agreement</u>

- **The First Statement of Work**. The Statement of Work is enclosed as an exhibit and includes a description of the services that the Advisor will provide to the Company and any fees that the Company will pay to the Advisor.
- **Relationship of the Parties.** Advisors are independent contractors, not employees, of the Company. That means that the Advisor is responsible for the Advisor’s own taxes and will receive a 1099.
- **Lobby Activity and Disclosure.** Advisor must (i) notify the Company if it believes any activities performed under the advisor agreement may be considered lobbying, and (ii) obtain the Company’s written approval before registering with a public company as a lobbyist.
- **Use of Advisor’s Name.** During the term of the advisor agreement and for one year thereafter, without Advisor’s prior written consent, the Company may disclose to its investors and potential investors that the Advisor is advising the Company and may also list the Advisor on its website or in any press releases. For any other public use of the Advisor’s name, the Company must get the Advisor’s permission in advance in writing.
- **Term.** The agreement will stay in effect until it is terminated by the Company or the Advisor. Each party can terminate the agreement (a) immediately if the other party materially breached the agreement or (b) with fourteen (14) days’ notice for any reason.

### <u>Attachment 1: IP and Restrictive Covenant Obligations</u>

- **Confidentiality.** Advisor agrees to keep this agreement and all information shared by the Company in connection with this agreement confidential. These restrictions exclude any information that is required by law to be disclosed by the Advisor or any information that is publicly available.
- **Non-Solicitation.** During the term and for one year thereafter, the Advisor will not solicit the Company’s employees or independent contractors.
- **Non Disparagement.** The Advisor will not make any negative or disparaging statements about the Company or its employees, investors, products or services.
- **The Company’s Intellectual Property.** The Company owns any intellectual property created by the Advisor in connection with the Advisor’s services or arising out of the Company’s confidential information.
- **The Advisor’s Intellectual Property.** The Advisor owns any intellectual property that the Advisor created prior to, or independently of the Advisor’s agreement with the Company. If the Advisor incorporates any of the Advisor’s own intellectual property into the Advisor’s work for the Company, the Company will have the right to use that work.
