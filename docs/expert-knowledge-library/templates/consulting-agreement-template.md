Download the template and review the summary for a quick breakdown of the key provisions such as the relationship between the parties, confidentiality obligations, intellectual property rights, and termination provisions.

## Summary of the Consulting Agreement Template
Our template consultant agreement includes the following terms and conditions.  The “Company” refers to the company (OpCo) that contracts with the consultant.

### <u>Body of Agreement</u>
* **The First Statement of Work.** The Statement of Work is enclosed as an exhibit and includes a description of the services that the Consultant will provide to the Company and any fees that the Company will pay to the Consultant.

* **Relationship of the Parties.**  Consultants are independent contractors, not employees, of the Company. That means that the Advisor is responsible for the Advisor’s own taxes and will receive a 1099.

* **Lobby Activity and Disclosure.** Consultant must (i) notify the Company if it believes any activities performed under the advisor agreement may be considered lobbying, and (ii) obtain the Company’s written approval before registering with a public company as a lobbyist.

* **Use of Advisor or Consultant’s Name.**  During the term of the consultant agreement and for one year thereafter, without Consultant’s prior written consent, the Company may disclose to its investors and potential investors that the Consultant is advising the Company and may also list the A Consultant on its website or in any press releases.  For any other public use of the Consultant’s name, the Company must get the Consultant’s permission in advance in writing.

* **Term.** The agreement will stay in effect until it is terminated by the Company or the Consultant.  Each party can terminate the agreement (a) immediately if the other party materially breached the agreement or (b) with fourteen (14) days’ notice for any reason.

### <u>Attachment 1: IP and Restrictive Covenant Obligations</u>

- **Confidentiality.** Consultant agrees to keep this agreement and all information shared by the Company in connection with this agreement confidential. These restrictions exclude any information that is required by law to be disclosed by the Consultant or any information that is publicly available.
- **Non-Solicitation.**  During the term and for one year thereafter, the Consultant will not solicit the Company’s employees or independent contractors.
- **Non Disparagement.** The Consultant will not make any negative or disparaging statements about the Company or its employees, investors, products or services.
-  **The Company’s Intellectual Property.**  The Company owns any intellectual property created by the Consultant  in connection with the Consultant’s services or arising out of the Company’s confidential information.
- **The Advisor’s Intellectual Property.**  The Consultant owns any intellectual property that the Consultant created prior to, or independently of the Consultant’s agreement with the Company.  If the Consultant incorporates any of the Consultant’s own intellectual property into the Consultant’s work for the Company, the Company will have the right to use that work.
