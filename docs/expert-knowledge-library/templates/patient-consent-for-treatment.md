# Patient Consent to Treat Template

Contact your Legal POC with questions regarding this template. Hilary Bowman and Herschel Goldfield are SMEs for this content

The form provided below is a generic form for a healthcare provider that provides both in-person care and telehealth care.  If the provider provides only in-person or only telehealth services, different language is needed.

In addition, this form will almost certainly have to be modified to accommodate the specific conditions of the healthcare practice.  For example, the form would have to be changed/customized in the following situations:

* Pediatric patients (i.e., patients under 18)
* Surgical procedures
* Use of off-label treatment
* Use of high energy devices such as lasers or x-rays
* If there are specific known risks typically associated with the services provided by the applicable practice.
* In addition, while not always in the consent form, it is often prudent that the administrative process also record the name and contact information of an emergency contact.

Note also that depending on the situation, you may be required to obtain informed consent in a foreign language.
