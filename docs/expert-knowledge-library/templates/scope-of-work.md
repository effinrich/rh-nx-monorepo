# Template: Scope of Work

A freelancer's scope of work outlines the freelancer’s contribution to a project. The scope is also the place to “tack on” smaller, ad hoc tasks—so long as the freelancer agrees upfront, it’s an efficient use of everyone’s time and resources. (Tip: Don’t confuse a scope of work with a statement of work, both sometimes referred to as an “SoW.” A statement of work is a longer, more formal arrangement; for guidance, connect with your RM. In addition, a scope of work should not be used as a substitute for a formal contractual agreement where needed. Consult with your legal point of contact to determine when this may be required.)


A scope of work generally includes the following sections, which can be modified to match project needs:

* Project Overview & Goals
* Key Deliverables
  * With specifications aligned with freelancer work product
* Project Timeline
* Milestones
* Resource Requirements
* Benchmarks

Other sections you might include, if relevant, are:

* Company Background & Overview
* Roles and Responsibilities
* Relevant Source Material
