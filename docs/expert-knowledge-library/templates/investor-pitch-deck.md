# Template: Investor Pitch Deck

There are several ways to build out an effective fundraising pitch deck for investors that consider good design, the right mindset, and the appropriate length and content to anticipate questions from investors.

Craft a compelling investor pitch deck to attract potential investors and persuade them to back your business.

The Investor Pitch Deck Template provides  sample slides you can use in association with our Delivering a Fundraising Pitch to Investors guide.

The guide includes a table which outlines content (primary and secondary points) and questions that should be answered by the slides in your pitch deck. The order of the sections may vary depending on the flow and stage of your company.
