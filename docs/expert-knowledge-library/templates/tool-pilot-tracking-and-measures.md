# Tool: Pilot Tracking and Measures

When implementing your first pilot, you can use this spreadsheet tool for tracking pilot progress and measuring pilot success. Specifically, tabs cover timeline, pilot plan, and roles & responsibilities. We encourage you to think of this tool as an artifact to share with your pilot partner when initially kicking off the pilot. Remove any contextual and instructional content (such as this tab) to focus solely on the information relevant to your specific pilot. Remember to use legal support for any agreements (LOI, collaboration, pilot agreement).
