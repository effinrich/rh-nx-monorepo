# Increasing Customer Delight and Employee Surplus to Maximize Profit

Inspired by HBS Professor Felix Oberholzer-Gee, Venture Chair Nate Snyder will lead an interactive session exploring a famous business strategy that primarily relies on customers’ perceived value of goods or services to determine cost. This "value stick framework" offers a helpful way of visualizing the tenets of pricing and considers how firms can maximize profit margins while creating more value for customers and suppliers. This is especially relevant to companies operating in highly competitive and price-sensitive markets.
