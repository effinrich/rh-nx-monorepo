# Public Funding for Early-Stage Healthcare Companies Fireside Chat

This presentation identified the most common types of funding opportunities and how to know what's available, provided an overview of the application process and how to best position for success, and also discussed the challenges that applicants will need to navigate. We also provided a case study of an OpCo that has successfully secured grant funding multiple times. The chat was moderated by Danielle Russella and led by Beverly Grossman, VP of Government Affairs at Redesign, who has over two decades of working in grant and RFP dependent organizations in the health and human services industry, and Cynthia Benjamin, CEO of Together Senior Health, who has raised over $8M in grant funding through 5 successful awards.
