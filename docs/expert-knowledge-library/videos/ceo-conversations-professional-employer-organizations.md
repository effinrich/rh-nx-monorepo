 **<a id="summary"></a>Key Takeaways**

**Overview of Stitch PEO**

* Rajesh Voddiraju, [Stitch PEO](https://stitchpeo.com/), a company built at Redesign Health, gives a quick overview of what his company offers. Currently licensed in eight states, Stitch is a PEO for the healthcare industry that offers payroll and benefits including medical, dental, vision, short-term and long-term disability, 401k plans, and voluntary benefits. Stitch offers several different service plans based on their customers' needs. *(02:52)*

**Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangement (ICHRA) vs. a PEO**

* PEOs provide various professional services (payroll, HR administration, and benefits) under one umbrella. *(05:12)*

* ICHRA is not a PEO, but an option to fund employee healthcare through state exchanges. Ken Park, CEO of Veda, researched and opted against ICHRA due to limited options and found healthcare benefits separately through a broker. *(01:26)*

**Important PEO considerations**

* **Co-employment relationship:** When you work with a full services PEO, you’re actually entering a co-employment relationship with them. Your employees aren’t just your employees, they're also the employees of the PEO. The PEO pools a bunch of small companies into one large bucket and operates as if they’re a large group employer, which allows the smaller companies to have access to benefits that they wouldn’t otherwise be able to access. *(06:22)*

* **Have a strong understanding of Human Resources (HR) compliance needs:** If you’re not up to speed on what you should be doing from an HR compliance perspective, it can be easy to trip up. *(14:58)*

* **Restrictions vary by state:** PEOs have state-specific restrictions on co-employment for payroll purposes. *(15:31)*

* **Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI) and Workers Compensation:** It’s important to understand your deductible and whether or not you’re covered under your own group coverage or under an aggregate coverage for all of the clients of the PEO. *(18:25)*

* **PEO specialization:** There are PEOs who specialize in certain industries, like life sciences, and as a result they end up with a different set of actuarial tables for their underwriting which they think are beneficial for them. *(18:56)*

**Who might benefit most from working with a PEO**

* A PEO is a more comprehensive solution than ICHRA or buying payroll as a service and complementing it with a broker for specific health benefits. *(23:05)*

* PEOs are a great option for companies with 5 to 50 employees. *(23:45)*

    * The majority of PEOs typically stipulate a prerequisite of at least five employees for enrollment. However, many also incorporate an exception rule for venture-backed companies, allowing them to join even with fewer than five employees. *(26:49)*

**Major players in the PEO space**

* Tim Danison, CEO of TempoPay, shares a market map highlighting the top 10 PEOs by worksite employee (total combined number of employees they serve) count, including both public and private equity-backed companies.

**Switching benefits during the benefit year**

* It’s possible to switch benefits during the benefit year. You can request a statement of benefits from your previous insurers to provide to your new insurer, ensuring they’re aware of how much of your deductible you have already utilized. *(32:24)*

      * It varies from carrier to carrier, so you must do your diligence. *(32:55)*

      * It’s better to standardize the timelines for all of your offerings to your employees. *(34:57)*

**Deciding employer contributions**

* Employer contribution percentages depend on workforce demographics. *(39:30)*

* Ultimately, you should consider whether or not you’re competitive. *(40:17)*

      * Tim shares that most employers in the United States match or contribute between 60% and 70% of the healthcare coverage that an employee is going to need on average. *(41:26)*

**Virtual care as a benefit**

* Rajesh Voddiraju, CEO of Stitch PEO, discusses a telehealth benefit that provides 24/7 access to physicians who can diagnose and prescribe medication, at a cost of $20 per household per month. *(43:48)*

**Getting started with 401k**

* Tim recommends offering a basic 401k, stating that if you opt for a basic plan, there's no reason not to provide it to your employees. He notes that as soon as employees begin contributing, they will help offset the administrative costs. *(52:00)*

* Rajesh emphasizes the need for educating employees on the benefits of participating in a 401k plan. *(53:20)*
