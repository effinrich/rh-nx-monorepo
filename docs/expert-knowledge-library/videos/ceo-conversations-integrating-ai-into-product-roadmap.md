# CEO Conversations: Integrating AI into the Product Roadmap

In this CEO conversation, CEOs with experience integrating AI into a product roadmap—Corey Zankowski (Primum Health), Adam Pellegrini (Jasper Health), Patrick Mobley (Vivid Health), and Jon Cooper (Overalls)—discuss where to start, how to progress, and decision factors around partnering with external consultants or vendors.

**<a id="summary"></a>Summary**

Inspired by interest following the [CEO Summit session on AI](https://www.redesignhealth.com/blog/news/unleashing-the-power-of-generative-ai-and-llms-in-healthcare-insights-from/), OpCo CEOs Corey Zankowski (Primum Health), Adam Pellegrini (Jasper Health), Patrick Mobley (Vivid Health), and Jon Cooper (Overalls) share insights and learnings from their experience building AI into their roadmaps, including tactical insights into:

* Where and how they got started (analysis and decision processes).

* Whether they partnered with an external consultant to help determine the plan.

* Which vendors, if any, they decided to use.

* Primum’s plans to integrate generative AI into their platform.

**Key Takeaways**

**Where each OpCo began with implementation** *(06:55)*

* Overalls engaged an independent consultant to help them figure out how they could benefit from AI and what low hanging fruit existed. Jon’s team also experimented with consumer-facing AI tools to get a better understanding of how it could serve them.

    * Overalls does not currently have a team member dedicated to AI.

    * “I thought that was a blocker that we had, and it turns out a little consulting plus your existing team can at least unlock part of the way there.” *(Jon, 11:00)*

* Jasper Health’s approach involved predictive technology and using relevant healthcare data points for specific patient profiles. They also explored increasing coaching efficiency through automated responses based on chat transcripts. They hosted a hackathon to come up with creative, yet practical ideas.

    * The Jasper AI team consists of around six engineers, including two full-time engineers dedicated to AI implementation.

    * Adam shares that his goal is to build an oncology AI service in addition to the core business. “If we can get a 100 x efficiency gain using AI, like what we're already doing at Jasper, imagine selling that as a service to increase efficiency, as well.” *(Adam, 20:47)*

* The Primum team became proficient themselves and is using Chat GPT to augment physician consultants in providing medical recommendations based on guidelines, literature, and clinical trials.

    * They are considering working with a commercial provider called Puppeteer to integrate AI into their customer-facing solutions. They also hired a college intern and a couple of high school students who were knowledgeable in AI.

* AI was built into the Vivid Health roadmap from the very beginning because of the timing of when the company formed (AI was in the news and he didn’t want to regret not starting out with it).

**Choose a service that is HIPAA compliant from the beginning** *(29:27)*

* Adam dives into the issues that can arise if a company doesn’t use HIPAA-compliant services and software.

**Don’t reinvent the wheel** *(41:46)*

* Jon reminds the group that you don’t need to build your own model in many cases. Start with off the shelf tech and work towards customizing existing resources to fit your business. This makes it more accessible and an easy way to learn and test.

* “You don't need to have an AI team because you're not actually building AI at this point. You're just using models.” *(Corey, 43:04)*

**Deciding when to introduce AI** *(44:05)*

* Adam acknowledges that there will never be an “easy” time to introduce AI, especially for an older OpCo, but he has a “better now than never” mentality. He also reminds the group that this type of endeavor is easier at a startup.

   * Jon encourages the group to think about whether or not AI would have an impact on their marketability. For Overalls, it provides marketability and tangible ROI as they fundraise and talk to large employers who ask how they will scale their business.


**Human plus bot, not bot plus human** *(50:35)*

* As Adam explains, healthcare requires human empathy that AI cannot create or imitate. He suggests, however, that it can free up employee time and provide more longitudinal care capabilities to the human care coaches.

    * “We like to say that we want the nurse to be left with nothing to do but provide care.” *(Patrick, 53:28)*

**Legal considerations** *(54:07)*

* Basic legal aspects like data sharing and HIPAA are manageable with healthcare attorneys. Nixon is recommended for complex legal matters to avoid pitfalls.

* Involving clinicians in AI decision-making can enhance FDA compliance. Clinical data should avoid direct treatment decisions to mitigate risks.

**Architecture flexibility** *(01:02:50)*

* The group discusses the need to develop an LLM-agnostic architecture for flexibility in switching models. AI capabilities are rapidly evolving and you need to be able to change models based on what will best serve your company.

**Market differentiation and moats** *(01:05:23)*

* Patrick and Adam suggest that the quality of output matters most for market acceptance. Creating a unique moat involves leveraging data richness, go-to-market strategy, and product uniqueness.

* Corey recommends prioritizing customer needs and problem-solving over implementing AI tools for the sake of having them.

**How to jumpstart AI initiatives** *(01:13:35)*

* The group discusses engaging the entire company through hackathons as a way to encourage creativity and buy in.

* Jon suggests making it part of your personal workflow to gain familiarity with consumer-facing tools that can provide insights into potential business applications.
