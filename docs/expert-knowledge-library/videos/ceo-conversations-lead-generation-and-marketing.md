 **<a id="summary"></a>Key Takeaways**

**Lead Generation Strategies**

**Robert Coombs, Baton** *(2:05)*

* Robert discusses Baton’s lead generation product, drawing parallels with HubSpot's early strategy. Hubspot started with a website analysis product that provided feedback on how to improve your site’s SEO, but while customers were using that feature, they were becoming more interested in HubSpot’s CRM.

* Baton employs a lead generation strategy in the credentialing sector by addressing a universal task: primary source verification. They've introduced a free universal credentialing directory, essentially a compilation of databases they're already building pipelines towards.

* Robert recommends focusing on small, seemingly trivial tasks to provide solutions for potential clients.

**Barry Saik, Soundry** *(8:54)*

* Barry shares that Soundry publishes webinars and white papers as part of their  lead gen strategy.

* Soundry’s Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) ratio makes it impractical to engage in lead nurturing. They allow users to independently sign up and experience the product without consuming valuable staff time. This enables them to use the product to qualify leads further before proceeding to a sales call, which is usually necessary down the line.

* Robert urges the group to consider their internal practices for assessing opportunities. He illustrates this with an example of developing an ROI calculator and offering it on the company's website. This way, potential clients provide essential information, helping the company evaluate whether they qualify as valuable leads or not. *(11:44)*

**Mike Desjadon, Anomaly** *(20:00)*

* Mike outlines a focused lead generation strategy for Anomaly’s AI products, emphasizing the importance of SEO and targeted Adwords. They aim for a small number of high-quality leads by precisely aligning with their niche. Despite the competitive and expensive landscape for AI-related terms, their success lies in attracting top-tier organizations through Google searches, particularly for AI in denials.

**Metrics and Tracking** *(14:02)*

* Barry discusses tracking metrics such as impressions and engagement across different channels.

* Raj shares that Stitch PEO has had success with using lead gen forms on LinkedIn.

**Facebook for Marketing to Providers** *(27:20)*

* Barry suggests identifying the platforms where your customers are most active. For his company, he notes that acupuncturists are commonly on Facebook, whereas chiropractors tend not to be as active on Facebook.

* The group discusses a company called Iqvia that uses narrowcasting based on NPI to target practitioners with Facebook ads. CardioOne has had success using this service and Dave Terry of Valendo says they are starting to work with them in the coming weeks.

**Referral Programs** *(30:24)*

* Soundry's $100 credit for customer referrals has proven to be a successful strategy.

* Corey Zankowski shares that Primum offers $100 to both the person referring and the person who then asks a question because their currency is the number of questions that can be generated on the platform. It’s their most successful program.

**Earned Media** *(33:45)*

* Jon shares his experience with earned media, recently securing placements on Bloomberg and The Street, emphasizing the importance of finding the right person or agency for press coverage. He suggests that the most successful freelancers he has worked with have been former journalists rather than professional PR practitioners. He recommends White Label Media.

     * His takeaways were that earned media has led to an uptick in web traffic, but also in credibility.

* Alissa Meade, Together Senior Health explains that they have achieved positive results in gaining media attention through sponsored market reports. In collaboration with a consulting group, they sponsored a survey, and the findings were disseminated in a market report. The success of their initial effort led to significant earned media, and they are currently in the process of producing a second report.

**The Handoff from Marketing to Sales** *(42:03)*

* Jon shares that for Overalls, marketing is everything until the meeting is booked, but at the same time their sales person does a lot of sourcing their own deals.

* Mike says that they have a content strategy and they will bonus their engineers for writing blog posts which provides credibility.

**Outsource Vendors** *(45:43)*

* Raj recommends [Acquirent](https://acquirent.com/), who they are working with for outsourced SDRs. They start with a target list and use email, calls, and LinkedIn.

**AI and Content Generation** *(36:36)*

* The group discusses AI for content drafting and lead generation activities. They discuss tools for generating article drafts and content ideas.

* They highlight the need for human review and editing to ensure quality.

* Barry shares that he has had luck with using Chat GPT to write a first draft of an article for a SME to get them started. Corey is using Jasper.IA in the same way.

* Robert shares that he uses [Taplio](https://taplio.com/) for social content.
