**Key Takeaways**

**Balancing Control and Flexibility** *(05:24)*

* Kurt emphasizes the trade-off between control and quality versus flexibility and scalability when deciding between W2 and 1099 staffing models. These will change over time based on where your company is in its growth path.

**Differentiating Between Provider Types** *(10:45)*

* Kurt sees no optical difference between the two types. Amwell patients do not know if the providers are W2s or 1099.

* Kurt explains how Amwell has structured contracts differently for part-time contractors compared to on-demand 1099 providers, ensuring availability and commitment levels align with patient needs.

**Quality Control in Staffing Models** *(13:50)*

* Kurt highlights that with the right systems in place, there isn't a significant difference in quality between W2 and 1099 providers. Amwell uses chart audits, algorithms, and quality reviews with score cards to maintain consistent care.

* This was initially a major concern for Amwell, but in hindsight, it shouldn’t have been.

**Consideration of Scale and Redundancy** *(16:16)*

* Kurt advises being cautious about relying too heavily on a small group of W2 providers to avoid disruptions in service delivery. If someone is sick or leaves, it leaves a huge gap to fill. He mentions that having a diverse pool of contractors provides more flexibility.

* This problem goes away if you’re working with hundreds of W2s, but when you are getting started, it’s not feasible.

**Demand Forecasting for W2 Providers** *(17:50)*

* Kurt explains how Amwell structures its systems to ensure that W2 providers are utilized effectively, especially during off-peak hours. They schedule the W2s during the times that contractors are less likely to show up. There is also an incentive for the W2s to see more patients.

**Investor Perspective on Staffing Models** *(22:35)*

* Kurt suggests that investors generally view a 1099 model more favorably due to its flexibility, but emphasizes that the choice should align with the specific service being offered.

**Flexibility in Work Arrangements** *(23:21)*

* The discussion touches on the potential demand for part-time arrangements, especially in the therapist space, and how this can offer flexibility for clinicians. For this specific use case, Kurt suggests it could certainly work, but it’s not something Amwell has done in the past because of their scale.

**Specialized Teams and Training** *(25:44)*

* Kurt describes instances where Amwell has created specialized teams for specific programs, providing additional training and support to ensure the success of those initiatives.
