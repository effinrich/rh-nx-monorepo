# Template: Board Meeting Minute with Option Grants

Use this template to document the minutes to your company board meetings, particularly when an agenda item is approving option grants. This is a common instance for start ups as new members are sometimes offered option grants — the right to acquire a set number of shares of stock at a set price.

During your bounded engagement, work with your Relationship Manager and Redesign Legal Point of Contact for questions about how to best use this template.
