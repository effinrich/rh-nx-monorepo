[Resource Description From the OIG: ](https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-02-20-00723.asp)

*This toolkit provides detailed information on methods to analyze telehealth claims to identify program integrity risks associated with telehealth services. This toolkit is intended to assist public and private sector partners—such as Medicare Advantage plan sponsors, private health plans, State Medicaid Fraud Control Units, and other Federal health care agencies—in analyzing their own telehealth claims data to assess program integrity risks in their programs.*

*Gaining a better understanding of the program integrity risks associated with telehealth services can help policymakers and stakeholders develop necessary safeguards and address individual cases of potential fraud, waste, and abuse. Doing so will help ensure that the benefits of telehealth are realized while minimizing risk in an effective and efficient manner."*
