# Github Actions

*[Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)* is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

The Platform service infrastructure uses Github Actions as part of its continuous integration (CI) framework.
