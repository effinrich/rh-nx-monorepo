# HashiCorp Vault

*[HashiCorp Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/what-is-vault)* is an identity-based secret and encryption management system. It validates and authorizes clients (users, machines, apps) before providing them access to secrets or stored sensitive data.

The Platform service infrastructure supports Vault as an option to secure, store, and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, encryption keys for protecting secrets and other sensitive data using a UI, CLI, or HTTP API.
