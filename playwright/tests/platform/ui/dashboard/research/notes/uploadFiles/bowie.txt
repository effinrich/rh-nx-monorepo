The Next Day is the 25th studio album by the English musician David Bowie (pictured), released in March 2013. It was his first studio release in ten years, as Bowie had retreated from public view after undergoing a procedure to treat a blocked heart artery in 2004. Co-produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti, the album was recorded in secret in New York City between May 2011 and October 2012. Primarily an art-rock album, The Next Day references Bowie's earlier glam and funk releases. The album was released through ISO Records in association with Columbia Records. The lead single, "Where Are We Now?", and news of the album were posted online on 8 January 2013, Bowie's 66th birthday, surprising fans who thought that he had retired from music. The Next Day topped charts worldwide and debuted at number one and two on the UK Albums Chartand the US Billboard 200, respectively. Bowie's highest-charting US album to date, it was praised by critics as Bowie's best in decades and placed on several year-end lists. (Full article...)
