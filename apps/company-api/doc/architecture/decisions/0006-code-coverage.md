# 6. Code Coverage

Date: 2022-10-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We currently do not have a tool to track code coverage in this project.

## Decision

We will use [JaCoCo](https://www.jacoco.org). There's a list of [Java Code Coverage tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_code_coverage_tools), but none of them seem to be maintained outside of JaCoCo.

## Consequences

We are adding another dependency to maintain in our repository.
